Seeing The Unseen

An AI Assistant for the Visually Impaired

📌 Overview

Seeing The Unseen is an AI-powered assistive system designed to help visually impaired users better understand their surroundings through real-time audio feedback.
The system combines computer vision, speech processing, and intelligent automation to detect objects, read text, recognize currency, identify people, and describe scenes — all through a mobile application connected to smart glasses.

The goal is to increase independence, safety, and confidence by transforming visual information into meaningful audio insights.

🎯 Key Features

Object Detection – Identifies surrounding objects and announces them via voice output

Text Reading (OCR) – Reads printed text such as signs, documents, and labels

Currency Recognition – Detects and announces currency denominations

Person Identification – Identifies known individuals (where permitted)

Scene Description – Provides intelligent descriptions of the user’s environment

Real-Time Audio Feedback – Instant voice responses for seamless interaction

Offline Capability – Core functionalities work without internet access
